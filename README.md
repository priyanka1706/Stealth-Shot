# Stealth Shot
My version of a FPS multiplayer game built on Unreal Engine 4 during the first half of the course [Unreal Engine 4 Mastery: Create Multiplayer Games with C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealengine-cpp/) by Tom Looman.
The first version in it can be found in the V1 folder. The game supports both one and two player gameplay.

# Game mission
The aim of this game is to pick up the green loot and take it to the extraction zone without being spotted by any of the guards. To do this one cam distract the guards using noisy projectiles, and also use the launchpad to use alternate routes to reach the loot.
